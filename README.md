# Sentiment Recommendations and Research

This project is a two part research project.  I am looking to find out if there is a difference in the number of views and subscriptions for YouTube channels that have an over-all positive sentiment compared to those that have an over-all negative sentiment. 

## Background

This project was born out of tragedy.  A close friend's son lost his father and I started worrying about the path that her son may go down if he were to start clicking on various YouTube recommendations that are based on correlation and keywords alone.  I wanted to build a recommendation algorithm that would account for the general sentiment of a video as well as the similar key words and correlation to similar users. 

As I began to think about it more.  I started to wonder if there was any correlation between view counts and subscriber count to the general sentiment of a Channel.  Since this is my first project that did not come out of a text book.  I am going to start with this part of the project.  I this also makes sense since I will need to be able to test the sentiment of video titles/descriptions before I can determine if the sentiment is similar to other videos.
