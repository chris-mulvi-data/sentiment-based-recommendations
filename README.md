# Sentiment Recommendations and Research

This project is a two part research project.  I am looking to find out if there is a difference in the number of views and subscriptions for YouTube channels that have an over-all positive sentiment compared to those that have an over-all negative sentiment. 

## Background

This project was born out of tragedy.  A close friend's son lost his father and I started worrying about the path that her son may go down if he were to start clicking on various YouTube recommendations that are based on correlation and keywords alone.  I wanted to build a recommendation algorithm that would account for the general sentiment of a video as well as the similar key words and correlation to similar users. 

As I began to think about it more.  I started to wonder if there was any correlation between view counts and subscriber count to the general sentiment of a Channel.  Since this is my first project that did not come out of a text book.  I am going to start with this part of the project.  I this also makes sense since I will need to be able to test the sentiment of video titles/descriptions before I can determine if the sentiment is similar to other videos. 

## Hypothesis

I believe that channels with a primarily negative sentiment will have a higher view rate with a comparatively low subscription rate.  I expect the opposite to be true for channels with a primarily positive sentiment; they are likely to attract a larger subscriber base since people seem to want to support positive people.  The negative channels will have higher view counts since people seem to be drawn to sensationalism and emotionally charged topics.
